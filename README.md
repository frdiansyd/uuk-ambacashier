# Project Exam – Express.js and MongoDB

## Description

Welcome to the repository for the **Express.js and MongoDB Project Exam**. This project aims to demonstrate my understanding of using **Express.js** as a framework for building web applications and **MongoDB** as a NoSQL database for storing data.

This project involves creating a simple application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality to manage data, utilizing **MongoDB** to store and handle information.

## Objectives

This project aims to:

* Apply the basic concepts of Express.js in building a backend application.
* Use MongoDB as the database to store data effectively.
* Build an application capable of performing CRUD operations.
* Improve my understanding of **RESTful APIs**.

## Features

This application includes several key features, such as:

* **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations for data.
* Use of **MongoDB** as the data storage database.
* Simple data management through a **REST API**.

## Built With

* **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime used to run the application.
* **Express.js** – A minimalist framework for building web applications.
* **MongoDB** – NoSQL database used to store the data.
* **Mongoose** – Library for modeling MongoDB objects in Node.js.
* **Postman** or **Insomnia** for testing the API.

## Requirements

* **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
* **MongoDB** – You can use **MongoDB Atlas** (cloud) or local MongoDB installation.
